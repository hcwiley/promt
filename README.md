Prompt
======
[Promt][0] is a single page site that uses the [Google Places API][1] to
increase the probability of you successfully prying yourself from your
keyboard to meet your friends in time for happy hour.

If you're supposed to meet at the pub at 6, tell Promt and it'll let you
know when to leave based on your current location, and if you wish, remind you.

Hat tip to [WTFSIGTE][2].
